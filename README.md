## Project Explanation

This project, "Expanding Cards," was created as a study exercise to practice and reinforce skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to develop a visually appealing and interactive webpage that showcases expanding cards with dynamic content. Each card, when clicked, expands to reveal more information, providing an engaging user experience.

## Code Practices and Principles Followed

### 1. Semantic HTML:

The HTML structure uses semantic tags such as `<section>, <footer>, and <h1>`, which improve readability and accessibility of the code.

### 2. Separation of Concerns:

The project separates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into distinct sections/files. This makes the code easier to maintain and understand.

### 3. Responsive Design:

The CSS includes a media query to ensure the layout is responsive and looks good on various screen sizes, particularly mobile devices.

### 4. Accessibility:

Each panel has an aria-label attribute to provide descriptive labels for screen readers, improving the accessibility of the webpage.

### 5. Performance Optimization:

External resources such as fonts are imported using efficient @import rules in CSS.
Image URLs are optimized for performance by including parameters like w=800 and q=60 to control image size and quality.

### 6. Consistent Styling:

The CSS uses a consistent and readable style, with properties grouped logically and comments added for clarity.
Use of root-level CSS variables (:root) for setting the base font size, making it easier to manage and scale the typography.

### 7. JavaScript Best Practices:

The code is modular and reusable, with clear functions defined for specific tasks.
